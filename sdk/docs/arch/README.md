##Creating DB clients

We are using protobuf for all communication 
between the client and server as well as 
other support interfaces/structs.

The .proto files can be found in /proto.

There is a script in the JS client that downloads 
all of the needed support .proto files.

Please use the JS client as an example of how we
are building the client.  

There is a demo.ts file in this directory that 
demonstrates how withTransaction() works.  

You will find the TS client files in sdk/ts.

Ignore the 'legacyAdapter' directory.

The codec directory is auto generated by the 'compile-proto.sh'
script

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
