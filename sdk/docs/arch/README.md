## Running a Curium node

* Install starport `https://docs.starport.network/intro/install.html` with the recommended dependencies (except for nodeJS, not necessary for the curium project)
* `git clone https://github.com/bluzelle/curium.git`
* `cd curium`
* `starport serve`

Use the mnemonic for vuser for the client

## Creating DB clients

We are using protobuf for all communication 
between the client and server as well as 
other support interfaces/structs.

The .proto files can be found in /proto.

There is a script in the JS client that downloads 
all of the needed support .proto files.

Please use the TS client as an example of how we
are building the client.  /sdk/ts  

There is a demo.ts file in this directory that 
demonstrates how withTransaction() works.  
To run type 
`yarn; yarn start` in that directory.

You will find the TS client files in sdk/ts.

Ignore the 'legacyAdapter' directory.

The codec directory is auto generated by the 'compile-proto.sh'
script

Please let me know if you have any further questions.
